        <p>
            When you practice self-discipline by setting a goal, making a plan, and working on it every day, you will see personal development and progress within your career.
            I abide by my rules i made a plan and started investing on myself day by day i started learning new things and started focusing on gaining more and more knowledge. 
            Life is good now i feel like i am playing with codes, earlier i used to hate coding or programming but now thanks to my professors and my friends who have helped me out to overcome the fear of coding and programming. At the moment i feel it interesting to work on new tasks.
            After these many hardships i finally feel that i will become a good Computer Science Engineer and will enter the IT industry after my completion of Masters.</p>
